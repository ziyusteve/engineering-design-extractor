7.6 APPLY ABOVE SYSTEM AS 2 DISTINCTIVELY SEPARATE COATS AND OBSERVE THE
MINIMUM RECOAT TIME BETWEEN THE TWO COATS. THE TWO COATS SHALL BE OF
CONTRASTING COLOUR. WET ON WET APPLICATION IS NOT PERMITTED.
7.7
THE TOTAL DFT OF THE GLASS FLAKE REINFORCED EPOXY MUST COMPLY WITH 80/20 RULE,
DEFINED AS FOLLOWS: 80% OF ALL THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS SHALL BE GREATER THAN,
OR EQUAL TO THE SPECIFIED DFT, AND NONE OF THE REMAINING 20% OF MEASUREMENTS
SHALL BE BELOW 80% OF THE SPECIFIED DFT.
7.8 ALL WORK TO BE CONDUCTED IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE COATING MANUFACTURER'S
TECHNICAL DATASHEETS.

WASH ALL STEEL TO BE TREATED BY HIGH PRESSURE CLEANING (MINIMUM 25L/MIN AT
5000PSI) TO REMOVE LOOSE AND FLAKING MATERIAL AND TO REMOVE SALT
CONTAMINATION.
ABRASIVE BLAST CLEAN ALL SURFACES TO BE COATED TO AS1627.4 SA 2½ WITH A
SHARP AND ANGULAR SURFACE PROFILE AVERAGING 80-100µm Rz.
TEST FOR RESIDUAL SALTS AS PER AS3894.6 METHOD A, ALTERNATIVE 2.
THE RESIDUAL SOLUBLE SALT CONTAMINATION ON ANY BARE METAL SHALL BE LESS
THAN 50mg/m2 (5µg/cm2) OF TOTAL SOLUBLE SALTS (NOT ION SPECIFIC)
IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO APPLICATION OF THE FIRST COAT. ELECTRONIC SALT
DETECTORS MAY BE USED TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF WATER-SOLUBLE SALTS.
THE CONDUCTIVITY OF THE TEST LIQUID IS THEREFORE MEASURED AND THE
CONDUCTIVITY IN MICRO SIEMENS (PS) SHALL BE CONVERTED TO µg/cm2 OF RESIDUAL
TOTAL SALT CONTAMINATION BY USING THE FOLLOWING FORMULA FROM ISO 8502-9:
WHERE:
E1 = SURFACE CONCENTRATION OF TOTAL SALT IN µg/cm2
S = CONDUCTIVITY IN µS/cm
V = VOLUME OF EXTRACT SOLUTION IN ml
A TEST SURFACE AREA IN cm2
EXAMPLE:
= 5.6 µg/cm2 OF TOTAL SOLUBLE SALTS.
S = 70 µS/cm
V = 2 ml
